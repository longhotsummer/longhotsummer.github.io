  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <p>
  <a href="http://openbylaws.org.za">OpenByLaws.org.za</a> makes South Africa's by-laws freely available and easy to read and share. It transforms difficult to read, poorly scanned PDF files into webpages that are consistently and beautifully formatted, fully searchable and easy to link to. I was awarded a Code for South Africa Innovation Fellowship and a Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant for this project.

  <p>
  <a href="http://wazimap.co.za">Wazi</a> is a project to help journalists and others explore the demographics and political details of places around South Africa. The name comes from <i>ulwazi</i>, the Zulu word for <i>knowledge</i>, and the project is sponsored by <a href="http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/">Media Monitoring Africa</a>.

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    I swim, hike and bake bread, although not always at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have over 13 years of experience writing software. I most recently
    spent six years building core components of
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>
    &mdash; Amazon's premier Cloud Computing service &mdash;
    and have deep experience building complex distributed systems and web applications to manage them.
    I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and
    make peopleâ€™s lives easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have an MSc in Computer Science from UBC in Vancouver, Canada and a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science and Maths
    from Wits University, Johannesburg, South Africa.
