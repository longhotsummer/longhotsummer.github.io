Today I'm announcing [Slaw](github.com/longhotsummer/slaw), a lightweight [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/slaw) library
for producing and rendering legislative acts using the [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/) XML format.
It simplifies the process of parsing PDF and plain-text documents into Akoma
Ntoso XML and rendering that XML into well-formatted HTML.

Slaw is used by [openbylaws.org.za](http://openbylaws.org.za) to render the XML content of the by-laws
into HTML. It's also used by [steno.openbylaws.org.za](http://steno.openbylaws.org.za) to take
PDF and plain-text versions of the by-laws and generate the corresponding XML which powers the website.

Where Slaw Comes From
---------------------

When a started [Open By-laws South Africa](http://openbylaws.org.za) I needed a
tool to take the PDF versions of the by-laws available on the websites of South
African municipalities -- such as [Cape Town](www.capetown.gov.za/en/ByLaws/Pages/Home.aspx) -- and 
turn them into decent looking webpages that are easy to read, navigate and share.

The Akoma Ntoso XML format is designed to capture the structure and metadata of
an piece of legislation and met my needs. But I needed a way of generating the
XML from the PDF without having to write XML by hand. 

So I created Slaw. It does the following:

1. extracts plain text from PDF documents and cleans it up
2. parses that text into an XML format which captures the content and structure of the legislation
3. transforms the XML into HTML which, when paired with a CSS stylesheet, produces [legislation that is well formatted and easy to read](http://openbylaws.org.za/za/by-law/cape-town/2010/parking/).

Show Me the Code
----------------

Enough chit chat, here's how to use Slaw. We're going to convert [this PDF of Joburg's Metered Taxi by-law](http://openbylaws.org.za/za/by-law/johannesburg/2004/metered-taxi-minibus-midibus-and-bus/metered-taxi-minibus-midibus-and-bus-source-enacted.pdf) into HTML.

First, install the gem:

    $ gem install slaw

You will also need [xpdf](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) to do the PDF extraction. On a Mac you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

    $ brew install xpdf

Now fire up irb and lets grab the plain text from the PDF (which you should [download](http://openbylaws.org.za/za/by-law/johannesburg/2004/metered-taxi-minibus-midibus-and-bus/metered-taxi-minibus-midibus-and-bus-source-enacted.pdf)):

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'slaw'
# extract text from a PDF file and clean it up
extractor = Slaw::Extract::Extractor.new
text = extractor.extract_from_pdf('dogs-and-cats-source-enacted.pdf')
{% endhighlight %}

If you <code>puts text</code>, you'll get something like this:

{% gist longhotsummer/262bf9bfcf707c658217 %}

Slaw has managed to find and remove the table of contents and has done a reasonable job of fixing line wraps, etc.
Now let's parse that text into a by-law object, backed by XML.

{% highlight ruby %}
generator = Slaw::ZA::BylawGenerator.new
# tell the parser that section numbers come after the section title
generator.parser.options = {section_number_after_title: true}
bylaw = generator.generate_from_text(text)
# set the title
bylaw.title = 'By-laws relating to Dogs and Cats, 2005'
{% endhighlight %}

We can see the XML:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts bylaw.to_xml(indent: 2)
{% endhighlight %}

{% gist longhotsummer/369ebb4dab21d2161d8b %}

Now let's transform that into HTML:

{% highlight ruby %}
# render the by-law as HTML, using / as the root for relative URLs
renderer = Slaw::Render::HTMLRenderer.new
html = renderer.render(bylaw.doc, '/')
{% endhighlight %}

and if we link it to a stylesheet from openbylaws.org.za, we get this:

<div class="an-container">
{% include metered_taxi_bylaw.html %}
</div>

Not Quite Perfect, but Good Enough
----------------------------------

As you can see above, the process isn't perfect. For example, it's
struggled with the definition of **council** and doesn't like the fact
that Chapter 2 doesn't have a title. However, it's got 90% of the way there
with no input from us. It has correctly nested
lists and discovered section and chapter headings, even definitions of terms.

We built [steno.openbylaws.org.za](http://steno.openbylaws.org.za) to
capture the remaining 10%. It gives the user the opportunity to straighten up a few things
before converting it to XML. It also lets you set the publication date
and some other meta-data. Using Steno, we can capture a new, multiple-page by-law
in 10-20 minutes, which is far less than retyping it from scratch.

Steno is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/longhotsummer/steno).

How Slaw Works
--------------

Slaw uses Treetop to compile a grammar into a backtracking parser. The parser
builds a parse tree, each node of which knows how to serialize itself in XML
format. There's more information in the [README.md](https://github.com/longhotsummer/slaw#parsing)
and I'll save the details for another blog post.

Use, Fork and Contribute
------------------------

Slaw is licensed under an MIT license and we welcome pull requests and discussion.
I'm excited to see how others can make use of this and slowly push forward the
boundaries of the Free Access to Law movement around the world.
