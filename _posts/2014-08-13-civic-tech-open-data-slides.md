The slides for my recent talk at the [Cape Town Python User Group meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-Python-Users-Group-CTPUG/) are available in their original form at [http://kempe.net/talks/2014-08-ctpug/](http://kempe.net/talks/2014-08-ctpug/) or you can view the PDF below.

The talk covers two tools which I built together with [Code for South Africa](http://code4sa.org) for [Media Monitoring Africa](http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/).

* [Dexter](https://github.com/Code4SA/mma-dexter) is a human-augmented machine learning tool for analysing news articles. It powered their awesome [2014 South African National Elections report](http://elections2014.mediamonitoringafrica.org/), giving some deep insight into how the South African media covered our national elections.
* [Wazi](http://wazimap.co.za/) is a tool for exploring South Africa through the eyes of the 2011 Census. It's far too easy to waste hours exploring this.

Here are the slides:
