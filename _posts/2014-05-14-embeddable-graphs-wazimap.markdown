You can now embed graphs from [Wazi][wazi] into your website, blog or news article! For example, here's the breakdown of how many people have access to toilet facilities in the [Amahlathi Municipality](http://wazimap.co.za/profiles/municipality-EC124/) in the Eastern Cape.

<div class="text-center">
  <iframe id="cr-embed-municipality-EC124-service_delivery-toilet_facilities_distribution" class="census-reporter-embed" src="http://embed.wazimap.co.za/static/iframe.html?geoID=municipality-EC124&chartDataID=service_delivery-toilet_facilities_distribution&chartType=pie&chartHeight=200&chartQualifier=&chartTitle=Population+by+toilet+facilities&initialSort=&statType=percentage" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300" style="margin: 1em; max-width: 300px;"></iframe>
  <script src="http://embed.wazimap.co.za/static/js/embed.chart.make.js"></script>
</div>

Only 23% of the [122,778 people living there](http://wazimap.co.za/profiles/municipality-EC124/#pop_count) have access to a flush or chemical toilet, 65% use a pit toilet and a scary 8.2% (about 10,000 people) have no access to any toilet facilities at all.

Another sobering statistic is the breakdown of the [highest education level](http://wazimap.co.za/profiles/municipality-EC124/#highest-educational-level) that people in the municipality have achieved.

<iframe id="cr-embed-municipality-EC124-education-educational_attainment_distribution" class="census-reporter-embed" src="http://embed.wazimap.co.za/static/iframe.html?geoID=municipality-EC124&chartDataID=education-educational_attainment_distribution&chartType=histogram&chartHeight=200&chartQualifier=Universe%3A+Invididuals+25+and+over&chartTitle=Population+by+highest+educational+level&initialSort=&statType=scaled-percentage" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="300" style="margin: 1em; max-width: 720px;"></iframe>

While almost 40% have completed at least Grade 9 (the level to which schooling in South Africa is compulsory), only 16% go on to complete Matric. This means that more than half of schoolgoers drop-out between Grade 9 and Matric.

You can embed any of the Wazi graphs in your news articles or blog posts by simply clicking the _embed_ link beneath the graph or chart and pasting the code it shows into your article or post.

This is a great feature from the guys behind [Census Reporter](http://censusreporter.org) on which Wazi is built.
